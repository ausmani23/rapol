###fig_trends
This graph plots trends in punitiveness, anxiety and mistrust in white and black respondents separately, over the period of the punitive turn. The three panels on the left plot hypothesized trends in these three dimensions across whites and blacks. The three panels on the right plot the trends that we estimate, using the data and methods described in Sections \ref{methods} and \ref{app_methods} in this paper. As a comparison of the left and right panels suggest, estimates presented here confound the conventional view. See Section \ref{publicopinion} for a complete discussion.
###fig_avgs
This graph plots the average responses to each of the 39 questions for which we have data over the period of the punitive turn. We divide these questions into three types: questions about punitiveness (top), questions about mistrust (middle), and questions about crime anxiety (bottom). The bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. As Section \ref{publicopinion} argues, raw levels of punitiveness and anxiety among blacks are at-odds with the conventional view. 
###fig_majorvotes
This graph plots the average proportion of members of the House voting punitively on each of the criminal justice bills for which we have voting data. The conventional view expects a consistent white-black gap, which this figure reproduces. But it also illustrates that key bills received majority support from African-American legislators. 
###fig_majorvotes_trends
This graph fits a smoothed line to the votes shown in Figure \ref{majorvotes}, where the bills are ordered (and spaced) by the year of the relevant vote. As the trend lines suggest, voting in the House became more punitive in the mid-late 1970s. Contrary to the conventional view, this punitive trend characterized the voting of black as well as white elected officials. 
###fig_marginals
This graph plots estimated marginal effects from a regression model fit to our public opinion data, in which we estimate the effect of a meaningful change in one of these covariates (age, education or gender) on the probability that a respondent answers punitively, mistrustfully, or anxiously. One might wonder whether black punitiveness and anxiety reflects the opinions of better-educated, richer blacks. In fact, we find that more educated blacks are less punitive and less anxious, which fits the idea that high levels of punitiveness and anxiety are driven by risk of victimization rather than respectability politics.
###fig_redistrict
This graph plots the average share of state legislatures that were African-American around federally-mandated redistricting in the early 1990s. It shows a discontinuity in redistricted states after the 1990 census, which is what we exploit in this paper to identify the impact of black representation on punitive outcomes. 
###fig_prefests
This figure plots estimates of the standardized impact of black political representation on two key outcomes: the officer rate, and the incarceration rate. The top panel plots the estimate that would be expected, on the conventional view. The middle panel plots the estimate from our preferred specification, which exploits federally-mandated redistricting in the 1990s. The bottom panel plots an estimate from a more conventional analysis of correlations in a state-year panel. In both cases, our best estimate is positive, which does not fit the conventional view. 
###fig_map
This figure proposes that the public's preferences around criminal justice reform be mapped in two rather than one dimension. The grey dot plots the hypothesized average preference of white Americans, while the black dots plot the average preference of blacks as hypothesized by the conventional view or one of the two revisionisms we discuss in this paper. Our argument is that if preferences around prisons and police are mapped unidimensionally, much of what is distinctive about African-American public opinion is ignored.
###fig_diffs
This figure plots the same data as in Figure \ref{fig_avgs}, but here focuses on differences (i.e. the estimated white-black gap) rather than raw levels. The average difference in each dimension is estimated by comparing the predicted probability of a positive response for whites and blacks, as estimated by the models described in Section \ref{pubopinion} and Section \ref{app_methods}. 
###fig_robests
This figure plots robustness checks for our estimate of the impact of black political representation on punitive outcomes. In general, it shows that our difference-in-difference estimates are considerably more robust than our ADL-based estimate. The main cause for concern here is the fact that the estimated impact of black representation on spending on prisons and police is negative in all cases, which invites some circumspection. See Section \ref{interpretation}, where we cite this result when distinguishing between weak and strong revisionism. 
###fig_unitroots
This figure plots results from unit root tests on the key covariates and dependent variables that we include in our model. No series is considered unit root by all three of the tests we use. Three of the series are declared unit root by a majority of unit root tests, so in robustness checks we consider a specification in which these three series are first differenced. In this specification the statistical significance of our key estimate fluctuates slightly, but the substantive implications are no different. 
###fig_94votes
This figure plots votes as the 1994 Clinton Crime Bill made its way through the House. It illustrates some of the dynamics discussed in Section \ref{interpretation}. Black elected officials opposed attempts to make the bill more punitive and less concerned with crime prevention. These efforts were mostly stymied by a coalition of white Democrats and moderate Republicans. In the end, black elected officials were confronted with an up-or-down vote on a bill that exaggerated their punitiveness and flattened their preferences. A majority of them voted for it. 
###fig_coverage
This figure shows some details about the public opinion data on which we rely in this paper. The dots are sized by the sample sizes we have for any given year from 1955 to the present. Reflecting the fact that not all questions are asked in most years, the graph is sparse. This illustrates the challenge of estimating trends: one can not just compare averages year-to-year, since movement in this average could just reflect the fact that different questions are being compared. To estimate trends, we model the probability of a positive response, controlling for question-level idiosyncrasies and a host of covariates. For more, see Section \ref{app_methods}.
